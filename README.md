# storage-net-retail-
Hello I'm John,
Let me just say. Imagine you have alot of junk in your storage and want to
sell it online! I want to know if it's a good idea or not if to start 
A consumer retail like eBay,amazon, apps such as offer up 
Etc.. In extension, dedicated to my late brother I would like to call it
Vic's clunk of junk or something like that... Let me know what you think bout the idea!
Please feel free for any helpful hints or ideas. I'm open for anything and everything.
God bless!!! John
